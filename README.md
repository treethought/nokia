## Why the name?

Refers to the Nokia 8110

> "Redpills use cell phones mainly to communicate with other redpills within and outside of the Matrix"

> "This cell phone type was the first of Nokia's high-end, 8xxx series of cell phones released during the mid-1990s. Its distinctive styling was the first example of a 'slider' form factor with a spring-loaded slider. This cell phone was mostly used during the early year of 2199 while the Resistance was searching for The One."
